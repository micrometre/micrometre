Hi, I'm Henok Wehibe (@micrometre)

I'm a passionate DevOps and Full-Stack Developer with a focus on Python, JavaScript, and Ansible. Currently, I'm diving deep into Python and React to build innovative web applications. I'm also excited about my latest project: an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system as a service.
